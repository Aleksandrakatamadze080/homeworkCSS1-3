    <h1 id="Big">BIG BANG THEORIES</h1>
    <p id="The">
        The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including
        astronomy, physics, philosophy, and metaphysics. The following is an
        overview of different theories related to the cosmos:
    </p>

    <div id="Bang">
        <h2 id="is">BIG BANG THEORIE</h2>
        <p id="it">
            This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution
            of the universe. The Big Bang theory suggests that the history of
            the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago.
            As a result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were
            created, leading to the expansion of the cosmos.

    <div id="Hole">
        <h2 id="Black">BLACK HOLE THEORY</h2>
        <p id="hols">
            Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are
            regions where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light,
            can escape. Black holes interact with nearby matter and can emit
            radiation.

    <div id="string">
        <h2 id="Theory">STRING THEORY</h2>
        <p id="its">
            String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of
            the physical world. According to this theory, we live in a
            three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain
            additional microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments)
            that are part of confined spaces with different sizes and
            characteristics.
        </p>

        <h3 id="point">
            Here are three key points about String Theory:
        </h3>
        <div id="of"></div>
        <p id="one">
            Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide
            a single framework that explains all fundamental forces and
            particles in the universe, including gravity, electromagnetism, and
            quantum mechanics.
        </p>



        <div id="al"></div>
        <p id="two">
            Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space,
            string theory proposes the existence of additional microscopic
            dimensions that are compactified, potentially influencing the laws
            of physics.
        </p>

        <div id="to"></div>
        <p id="three">
            Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental
            building blocks of matter are not point-like particles but rather
            one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies,
            with each vibration corresponding to a different particle type.
